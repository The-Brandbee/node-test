                  and Shivam Malaviya embarked on a remarkable journey that
                  would redefine the security landscape and founded CSP
                  Lighthouse. With over three decades of invaluable experience
                  in the IT industry the pair not only advocated, but also
                  zealously deployed Microsoft's cutting-edge cloud security
                  technology, orchestrating a paradigm shift in the way
                  businesses operated. Under their visionary leadership,

                  fortify cybersecurity compliance, leveraging established

                  benefits of the team's expertise with many more organizations
                  and take CSP global. CSP was rebranded as CSP Global and CSP
